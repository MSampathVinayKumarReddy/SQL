Get impressions, clicks using SUM, CASE and then using subquery/CTE write the logic.

select app_id, 
round(((100.0 * clk)/imp), 2) as ctr
from 
(
SELECT 
app_id, 
sum(case when event_type = 'impression' then 1 else 0 end) as imp,
sum(case when event_type = 'click' then 1 else 0 end) as clk
FROM events
where date_part('year', timestamp) = '2022'
group by app_id 
)x 


Optimized Solution

SELECT
  app_id,
  ROUND(100.0 *
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) /
    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END), 2)  AS ctr_rate
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' AND timestamp < '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY app_id;
