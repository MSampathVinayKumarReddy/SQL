MySol - 

dont order by sale column, order by sum(total_sales) desc else will sort by concatinated value which is not right

SELECT manufacturer, concat('$',round(sum(total_sales)/1000000, 0), ' million') as sale 
FROM pharmacy_sales
group by manufacturer
order by sum(total_sales) desc, manufacturer
